# Swift Memory Cache

A thread-safe, cost-based memory cache implementation with LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy. This cache is designed to handle memory pressure gracefully and provides detailed logging and performance monitoring through signposts.

## Features

- üîí Thread-safe implementation using Swift actors
- üìä Cost-based storage limits
- ‚ö°Ô∏è LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy
- üóëÔ∏è Automatic cleanup under memory pressure
- üìù Comprehensive logging and performance monitoring
- üíæ Configurable maximum item count and total cost limits

## Installation

Add this package to your project using Swift Package Manager:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/kraigspear/LRUActorCache.git", from: "0.1.0")
]
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

```swift
// Define a cached value type
struct CachedImage: CachedValue {
    let data: Data
    var cost: Int { data.count }
}

// Create a cache instance (10MB limit, max 500 items)
let cache = MemoryCache<String, CachedImage>(totalCostInMegaBytes: 10)

// Store a value
let imageData = Data() // Your image data
let cachedImage = CachedImage(data: imageData)
await cache.set(cachedImage, for: "profile-picture")

// Retrieve a value
if let image = await cache.value(for: "profile-picture") {
    // Use the cached image
}
```

### Advanced Usage

```swift
// Check if a value exists without affecting LRU order
let exists = await cache.contains("profile-picture")

// Clear the entire cache
await cache.removeAll()

// Create a cache with custom limits
let customCache = MemoryCache<String, CachedImage>(
    totalCostLimit: 1024 * 1024 * 20, // 20MB
    maxCount: 1000
)
```

## Memory Management

The cache automatically handles memory pressure events:
- On memory warning: Removes 50% of cached items
- On critical memory warning: Removes all cached items

Items are automatically evicted when:
- Total cost exceeds the specified limit
- Item count exceeds the maximum count
- System sends memory pressure notifications

## Protocol Requirements

To store a value in the cache, it must conform to the `CachedValue` protocol:

```swift
public protocol CachedValue {
    var cost: Int { get }
}
```

The `cost` property determines how much space the value takes in the cache. For example:
- For images: use the size of the image data
- For objects: use the estimated memory footprint
- For collections: use the count or total size of elements

## Thread Safety

The cache is implemented as an actor, ensuring thread-safe access to all operations. Always use `await` when calling cache methods:

```swift
await cache.set(value, for: key)
await cache.value(for: key)
```

## Logging and Performance Monitoring

The cache includes comprehensive logging using `OSLog` and performance monitoring with `OSSignposter`. This helps track:
- Cache operations
- Memory usage
- Eviction events
- Performance metrics
